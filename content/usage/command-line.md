## Command line options

```--summary```

Outputs a summary of the test which includes the following information

- Running Time
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Total Requests
- Number of Errors
- Availability (Total Requests vs. Number of Errors)
- Bytes Sent
- Bytes Received
- Mean Response Time
- Min Response Time
- Max Response Time 

```--duration=0s```

Sets the length of time the test will last.  By default the test will run until all urls have been executed or an execution plan has been completed a single time.  See [Valid Timeunits](#valid-time-units) for the value of this option.

```--wait-time=0s```

```--workers=1```

Sets the number of concurrent workers to use to execute the test.

- If using a URL file each worker will visit every URL in the file (unless a duration is set)
- If using a Scenario file each worker will execute each step of each job

```--random```

Sets the selection of the URL or the Job to be random.

```--progress```

Sets the progress bar to use. Available options are: `none|bar|logo`
